Homework &amp; Projects for Python course at Bioinformatics Institute

##Here is the README markdown
Well, the most dissatisfying thing I've found so far is that the default .md files in GitHub do not support math rendering
via MathJax or anything. That means, no beautiful LaTeX whatsoever. And that's surely miserable.  
Thankfully, GitHub still supports *text styling* **in the classic manner**. Many thanks.  
  
And code blocks are looking as usual, that is also cool. I.e.:
```
import numpy as np
will_you_be_happy = np.random.random(1) <= 0.00000001
print(will_you_be_happy)
```
